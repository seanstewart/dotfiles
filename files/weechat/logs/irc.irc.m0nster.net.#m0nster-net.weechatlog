2013-02-03 20:13:17	pat	and the paper money will burn
2013-02-03 20:13:43	pat	it's their way of giving back to society
2013-02-03 20:14:21	sean	/b/ is always so nice
2013-02-03 20:14:38	pat	I agree
2013-02-03 20:17:55	pat	I love /b/
2013-02-03 20:18:01	pat	anyways, god damn solubility rules
2013-02-03 20:20:00	sean	For chemestrie?
2013-02-03 20:20:34	sean	oh I has question
2013-02-03 20:20:52	sean	I was thinking about hosting my dot-files (config files) to git so that I can find them easily anywhere ...
2013-02-03 20:21:06	sean	Google Drive isn't easily accessed from a pure text env, esp considering I've got 2-step verification.
2013-02-03 20:21:17	sean	do you think that this is a goed idea?
2013-02-03 20:27:36	pat	sire
2013-02-03 20:27:46	pat	sure* let me read yo questionay
2013-02-03 20:28:00	pat	um
2013-02-03 20:28:06	pat	I say: no dis is not good idear
2013-02-03 20:28:09	pat	but
2013-02-03 20:28:15	pat	you have the organization and willpower to make it work
2013-02-03 20:28:22	sean	why is this not good idea D:
2013-02-03 20:28:48	pat	because you will need to use a browser to retrieve TUI config files
2013-02-03 20:29:08	pat	oh woops
2013-02-03 20:29:12	pat	I thought you meant google drive
2013-02-03 20:29:17	pat	well you can use git for that but it will be public
2013-02-03 20:29:22	sean	that's ok.
2013-02-03 20:29:30	pat	if you are comfortable with wasting github's space with your config files, then go for it
2013-02-03 20:29:38	sean	D:
2013-02-03 20:30:22	pat	alternatively you could just save your configs to a thumb drive, which would probably be morerer better for you
2013-02-03 20:30:45	sean	I was planning on saving them to git hub, soft linking them locally
2013-02-03 20:30:51	sean	and when I make a change, to commit those changes to git.
2013-02-03 20:30:58	sean	that way I always have the most recent versions.
2013-02-03 20:31:06	sean	But then again, I really don't make alterations to my configs ...
2013-02-03 20:31:07	sean	HM
2013-02-03 20:31:33	pat	on top of that fact, you might complicate things needlessly
2013-02-03 20:32:09	pat	you could complicate matters even more by running your own private git server
2013-02-03 20:32:23	pat	and then making sure you have your config pulled to two different IPs
2013-02-03 20:33:15	pat	let me put it this way, I think using git to commit changes to a local repo for your config is a great idea
2013-02-03 20:33:43	pat	but I don't think it's necessary to push it onto github or do any backup other than copying it to a thumb drive or another computer
2013-02-03 20:34:17	sean	I planned on doing it for the rare possibility I ever had to develop on a computer I don't own.
2013-02-03 20:34:54	sean	oh you
2013-02-03 20:35:03	sean	are you going to download those adv. tijd afleverings?
2013-02-03 20:35:12	sean	Or can I delete the sauce on my Maqintash?
2013-02-03 20:36:57	sean	are you worried about your sexy time?
2013-02-03 20:37:07	 *	sean violently shakes Pat
2013-02-03 20:37:31	sean	hm .... *writes something down*
2013-02-03 20:37:34	sean	Doesn't work on adults.
2013-02-03 20:39:20	pat	sorry
2013-02-03 20:39:27	pat	I am memorizing chemistry solubility rules
2013-02-03 20:39:38	sean	=/
2013-02-03 20:39:43	sean	I'll leave you tranquil alas.
2013-02-03 20:39:44	pat	oh
2013-02-03 20:39:51	pat	no I'm not worried about adventure time
2013-02-03 20:40:08	pat	don't care if I can't watch it right now, maybe later. something about jumping into the 5th season doesn't make sense
2013-02-03 20:40:32	sean	oh honestly
2013-02-03 20:40:35	sean	theres no progression
2013-02-03 20:40:38	sean	but I make comprehension.
2013-02-03 20:40:46	pat	good
2013-02-03 20:40:54	pat	I sense that there would be progression though
2013-02-03 20:40:58	pat	subtle themes and so on
2013-02-03 20:41:08	sean	yeah drugs
2013-02-03 20:41:09	sean	rape
2013-02-03 20:41:09	sean	sex

2013-02-03 20:41:14	sean	I see.
2013-02-03 20:44:15	pat	hmm
2013-02-03 20:46:53	sean	gah. I'm working on working on my linguistics presentation :3
