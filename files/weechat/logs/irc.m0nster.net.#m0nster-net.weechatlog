2013-01-27 18:20:13	@sean	I haven't prayed yet to find out.
2013-01-27 18:20:15	@patrik	apparently IRC is usually much more efficient but perhaps with security issues
2013-01-27 18:20:39	@patrik	as in, hosting 100s of connections, it's much faster
2013-01-27 18:20:59	@sean	yeah
2013-01-27 18:21:05	@sean	but it doesn't matter if it's hosted internally
2013-01-27 18:21:11	@sean	b/c the VPN would negate all insecurity
2013-01-27 18:21:34	@patrik	do you mean at my office?
2013-01-27 18:21:40	@sean	Jazm.
2013-01-27 18:22:06	@patrik	well, I guess the security of the jabber protocol was worth the cost in resources for them
2013-01-27 18:22:16	@patrik	they loaded, especially on the AWS
2013-01-27 18:22:37	@patrik	they probably didn't want to transition anyone from xmpp to irc
2013-01-27 18:23:11	@sean	OH
2013-01-27 18:23:15	@sean	If it's on AWS
2013-01-27 18:23:17	@sean	then that's goldaen
2013-01-27 18:23:21	@patrik	yeah
2013-01-27 18:23:29	@patrik	they are moving a lot of shit onto AWS
2013-01-27 18:23:35	@patrik	but they also have a few in house servers
2013-01-27 18:23:47	@patrik	I believe I am usually connecting to the in house ones
2013-01-27 18:25:38	@sean	I see
2013-01-27 18:25:41	@sean	AWS is so good.
2013-01-27 18:25:45	@sean	They only charge you for what you use.
2013-01-27 18:25:51	@sean	instead of tarrif you in plans.
2013-01-27 18:26:07	@sean	O ... oh
2013-01-27 18:26:08	@sean	WOW
2013-01-27 18:26:12	@sean	Weechat can connect to Jabber.

2013-01-27 19:21:06	Sean	I just read that
2013-01-27 19:21:39	Sean	The vagina. MYTH.
2013-01-27 19:21:51	@patrik	A friend of mine is a nurse, and I forget the details but either he -was- a gynecologist or worked with a gynocologist. A woman came in complaining about abdominal pains so the doctor decided to have a look in there. He pulled out a tampon... and another... and another, and I don't know exactly how many, but most of them were compacted into balls and the situation just got smellier and grosser.
2013-01-27 19:21:57	@patrik	Apparently she didn't know you have to remove tampons after a few hours.
2013-01-27 19:25:21	Sean	eww

2013-01-28 11:29:44	sean	hey girl
2013-01-28 11:29:53	sean	I'm in Discrete Meth.
2013-01-28 11:30:17	patatcal	I'm in the computer labs
2013-01-28 11:30:26	patatcal	I'm considering going to the chinese buffet here eventually.
2013-01-28 11:30:39	patatcal	I was reading about vim, mutt and fetchmail
2013-01-28 11:31:25	patatcal	Did you know you can define your own match groups with their own fg and bg colors?
2013-01-28 11:31:45	sean	That's cool
2013-01-28 11:31:51	sean	How could I use that tho o.o
2013-01-28 11:32:28	patatcal	I am trying to get real nasty with CLI programs
2013-01-28 11:32:37	patatcal	:hi[ghlight] [default] {group-name} {key}={arg} .. Add a highlight group, or change the highlighting for an existing group. See highlight-args for the {key}={arg} arguments. See :highlight-default for the optional [default] argument.
2013-01-28 11:33:43	patatcal	so, for example, you could create a regex that identifies everything you hate and highlight it in red
2013-01-28 11:34:11	sean	LOL
2013-01-28 11:34:17	sean	THAT
2013-01-28 11:34:20	sean	That appeals to me.
2013-01-28 11:34:26	patatcal	I felt that it would
2013-01-28 11:34:32	sean	I'm customising Weechat
2013-01-28 11:34:34	sean	to match Tmux :#
2013-01-28 11:35:18	patatcal	also, kinda weird, vim has its own spell checker...for 50 languages
2013-01-28 11:35:30	patatcal	that's nice
2013-01-28 11:35:54	patatcal	I want to run all old, crusty programs because that's how I roll
2013-01-28 11:36:16	sean	schweirdo.
2013-01-28 11:36:22	patatcal	oh, you can also define your own crazy vim status line too
2013-01-28 11:36:26	sean	Yeah!
2013-01-28 11:36:36	patatcal	that is dirty
2013-01-28 11:36:50	patatcal	can't wait to install arch, I just need a minute to backup my shit
2013-01-28 11:37:08	sean	I'm really interested in it too.
2013-01-28 11:37:10	patatcal	actually more accurately I need to clean up my pig sty and then backup my shit and then install arch. I hate life
2013-01-28 11:37:11	sean	I mean, how bad can it be?
2013-01-28 11:37:17	patatcal	probably not bad at all
2013-01-28 11:37:17	sean	I think pacman has more packages than yum
2013-01-28 11:37:26	patatcal	yess but they're non specific
2013-01-28 11:37:48	sean	What?
2013-01-28 11:37:52	sean	like non-patched?
2013-01-28 11:38:01	patatcal	no
2013-01-28 11:38:03	patatcal	generic
2013-01-28 11:38:22	patatcal	arch's shit has a reputation of being always up-to-date, always the latest
2013-01-28 11:38:47	patatcal	but it's not bsd specific, it's not debian specific, it's just straight up unixy packages
2013-01-28 11:38:53	sean	correct!
2013-01-28 11:38:55	sean	b/c it's linux.
2013-01-28 11:38:58	sean	It's THE linux.
2013-01-28 11:39:09	sean	The reason why they make deb packages
2013-01-28 11:39:12	patatcal	it's gnu/linux to the max
2013-01-28 11:39:15	sean	yeah
2013-01-28 11:39:29	sean	the only reason why they have packages for these distros, is b/c they can suggest they have certain pre-installed shit
2013-01-28 11:39:33	sean	that they have to interface with
2013-01-28 11:39:41	sean	yum, rpm, special prefixes
2013-01-28 11:39:45	patatcal	right
2013-01-28 11:39:48	sean	do the confs go in /usr/local/etc
2013-01-28 11:39:49	sean	or in /etc?
2013-01-28 11:39:55	patatcal	arch is just like, lulz you got gcc, get out there kid
2013-01-28 11:39:57	sean	each linux sets its own shit
2013-01-28 11:40:13	sean	Dr Natali. My Language and Gender professor uses Arch on a Dell laptop
2013-01-28 11:40:15	sean	as his main computer
2013-01-28 11:40:17	sean	with a GUI
2013-01-28 11:40:18	patatcal	I read "set your hostname by editing /etc/hostname" and went ....... :)
2013-01-28 11:40:19	sean	I think you'll be fine.
2013-01-28 11:40:35	patatcal	cat /etc/hostname
2013-01-28 11:41:08	patatcal	yea
2013-01-28 11:41:13	patatcal	I'd be okay if I didn't want to set up FDE
2013-01-28 11:41:29	sean	I'm sure it's easy.
2013-01-28 11:41:38	patatcal	dm-crypt makes me poop a little
2013-01-28 11:41:45	sean	Wat is dat?
2013-01-28 11:42:00	patatcal	it's what generates the encryption
2013-01-28 11:42:10	sean	Ah for Synergy Dildo interfacing?
2013-01-28 11:42:15	patatcal	dm-crypt is a transparent disk encryption subsystem in Linux kernel versions 2.6 and later and in DragonFly BSD. It is part of the device mapper infrastructure
2013-01-28 11:42:18	patatcal	. . .
2013-01-28 11:42:55	sean	ah yes. YES
2013-01-28 11:43:19	patatcal	it's why I was asking you about LVM yesterday
2013-01-28 11:43:52	patatcal	I was curious if I need to use or if I secretly want to use LVM, because it complicates the process of full disk encryption
2013-01-28 11:44:13	sean	oh
2013-01-28 11:44:21	sean	I thought most FDE NEEDS a LVM.
2013-01-28 11:44:49	patatcal	nooo
2013-01-28 11:44:53	patatcal	not device mapper
2013-01-28 11:45:02	patatcal	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt_with_LUKS#LVM:_Logical_Volume_Manager
2013-01-28 11:45:43	patatcal	"After writing the partition table to the MBR (optionally set up LVM thereafter) the next step is to create the LUKS and dm-crypt magic and make device mapper mount it to the filesystem of the installation system. "
2013-01-28 11:47:23	sean	SCHWEIRD
2013-01-28 11:47:32	patatcal	yeaaaaaa
2013-01-28 11:47:43	patatcal	this is...literally building FDE
2013-01-28 11:48:01	patatcal	for example you can also opt in or opt out of encrypting your swap
2013-01-28 11:48:17	patatcal	I like the dirty, filthy, awesome script at the bottom that allows you to detect if the boot partiton was modified
2013-01-28 11:48:38	patatcal	but I need to compare ciphers
2013-01-28 11:48:49	sean	I'm interested in your findings.
2013-01-28 11:49:04	patatcal	I think I'm going to go with aes-xts-plain64 because I hear it's more difficult to attack with striping
2013-01-28 11:49:16	sean	no what your disque?
2013-01-28 11:49:28	patatcal	what?
2013-01-28 11:49:35	sean	sorry
2013-01-28 11:49:40	sean	I sometimes type what my professor says
2013-01-28 11:49:51	sean	Is that your SWAP or your disc?
2013-01-28 11:50:31	patatcal	mein disk
2013-01-28 11:50:47	sean	My professor is actually German.
2013-01-28 11:50:51	sean	And he can't pronounce equivalent.

2013-01-28 11:51:36	sean	he's so silly
2013-01-28 11:51:39	sean	silly goose.
2013-01-28 11:52:03	patatcal	have you considered asking him to stop being german?
2013-01-28 11:52:11	sean	I will
2013-01-28 11:52:12	sean	right now
2013-01-28 11:52:44	sean	Entschuldingung Herr Hauskrecht, aber koennen-Sie Deutch bitte halten te sein.
2013-01-28 11:53:29	patatcal	did he comply?
2013-01-28 11:53:37	sean	He disappeared ...
2013-01-28 11:53:38	sean	weird.
2013-01-28 11:53:56	sean	I burped and it tasted like a martini.
2013-01-28 11:54:02	sean	I MIGHT have had one when I got up this morning at 5.
2013-01-28 11:56:40	patatcal	this man
2013-01-28 11:56:46	patatcal	this man has been around the block (cipher)
2013-01-28 11:56:46	patatcal	An encryption algorithm is not secure if it outputs the same result each time the same message is encrypted. Otherwise, an attacker knows when a message is repeated, and, depending on the context, this could be a security risk. Therefore SOMETHING has to change on a per-message basis, and that something is typically an initialization vector (IV).
2013-01-28 11:56:52	patatcal	But different encryption algorithms use IVs in different ways. In CBC, altering an IV alters the first "block" of a decrypted message in a very predictable way: changing the first bit of the IV changes the first bit of the decrypted message. Therefore if the IV changes in a predictable way, certain attacks are possible. In particular, if there's a reasonable chance the last few bits of an consecutive IVs go from 001 to 0010 to [CUT]
2013-01-28 11:56:59	patatcal	For this reason, CBC should have a RANDOM IV with each new message. EESIV doesn't meet this ideal, and theoretically this could lead to weaknesses; however, it's far better than having completely predictable IVs. (In fact, one can prove that as long as the underlying blockcihper, typically AES, is secure and each IV is random, there is no way for an attacker to distinguish CBC ciphertexts from random bits, even if the attacker [CUT]
2013-01-28 11:57:06	patatcal	XTS, on the otherhand, uses IVs in a completely different way. It uses a new-fangled crypto gadget (more on this in a bit) called a Tweakable Blockcipher. The idea here is that a TBC takes an extra input, the tweak, and it looks like a completely new random permutation each time the tweak changes. Crucially, this is true even if an attacker CONTROLS when and how the tweak changes. Therefore it looks like a completely new random[CUT]
2013-01-28 11:57:15	patatcal	In XTS, the IV is used as a tweak, and gets incremented with every block encrypted. The fact that the attacker might KNOW what tweak is being used doesn't help him distinguish XTS outputs from random gibberish.
2013-01-28 11:57:22	patatcal	So why should you trust a shiny new-fangled crypto gadget? Well, because there's a mathematical proof showing that any algorithm that can "break" the XTS's tweakable blockcipher (called XEX) can be used to make an algorithm that can "break" AES (or whatever blockcipher is being used). So you can trust XEX as much as you can trust AES, and you can trust XTS as much as you can trust XEX. Of course, there are always gaps between m[CUT]
2013-01-28 11:57:36	sean	interesting.
2013-01-28 11:59:00	patatcal	very much so
2013-01-28 11:59:15	patatcal	I was trying to decide between cbc-essiv, xts-plain64 and xts-essiv
2013-01-28 11:59:33	sean	I think you should use the synergy cypher
2013-01-28 11:59:41	patatcal	rot14
2013-01-28 11:59:43	patatcal	they'll never see it coming

2013-01-28 11:59:53	patatcal	hm
2013-01-28 12:00:02	patatcal	it works as long as your data is randomized
2013-01-28 12:00:04	patatcal	well, all of it

2013-01-28 13:58:48	sean	Here's something interesting I've been doing.

2013-01-28 13:59:40	patatcal	when I finally get home around 10 tonight I'll probably start to sync from synergy to my computer
2013-01-28 14:00:01	patatcal	and make a truecrypt volume on my external. hope I lose the keys

2013-01-28 19:05:35	@pat	her voice is crackling
2013-01-28 19:05:41	@pat	she graduated here and got her masters at WVU
2013-01-28 19:05:44	@pat	and worked in cobol
2013-01-28 19:05:59	@pat	she is going through the steps of writing a program
2013-01-28 19:06:03	@pat	I will teach you in a moment
2013-01-28 19:07:27	@pat	COBOL common business oriented language developed in early 1960s by Grace Hopper of the US Navy which was a joint effort by the government, business and major universities
2013-01-28 19:07:30	@pat	High-level A language that can be easily transferred from one computer system to another Doesn't require programmer to have working knowledge of computer's internal components Program statements are not closely related to internal characteristics of the computer
2013-01-28 19:07:34	@pat	Low-level Requires knowledge of computers internal components Cannot be transferred from one computer to another easily
2013-01-28 19:07:37	@pat	COBOL was officially approved in 1968 by ANSI
2013-01-28 19:07:39	@pat	COBOL 74
2013-01-28 19:07:40	sean	YAY
2013-01-28 19:07:42	@pat	COBOL 85
2013-01-28 19:07:44	@pat	COBOL 2002
2013-01-28 19:07:47	@pat	Advantages Machine independent english like self documenting handling of i/o in clear, efficient manner
2013-01-28 19:07:52	@pat	Disadvantages Very wordy Scientific app, process control app
2013-01-28 19:07:57	@pat	Disadvantages Very wordy Scientific app, process control app + operating systems are best created in other langs
2013-01-28 19:07:58	sean	So
2013-01-28 19:08:00	@pat	How to write programs Step 1. Understand the problem
2013-01-28 19:08:01	@pat	Aside: Record layouts describe the format of input files Printer Spacing Charts are used to find the sizes of variables Mathematical Equations are used for math and shit Program Specs are for specifying the program
2013-01-28 19:08:11	sean	I didn't know before that Ms. Hopper made the 1st programming language essentially.
2013-01-28 19:08:13	sean	And she's a woman.
2013-01-28 19:08:19	sean	I learned about that instantly in Belgium
2013-01-28 19:08:22	sean	in my logic course
2013-01-28 19:08:28	sean	Now is the first time I'm hearing about it in the US.
2013-01-28 19:08:45	@pat	yes the professoreess made a point to tell us that she was a woman (maybe she isnt anymore)
2013-01-28 19:08:59	@pat	and that there is a Hopper day for ladies in CS
2013-01-28 19:09:06	@pat	there's a million days for ladies in CS

2013-01-28 19:11:42	@pat	I have to watch what I type because there are so many keybindings at work
2013-01-28 19:11:48	@pat	between screen vim and irssi
2013-01-28 19:13:45	sean	yeah
2013-01-28 19:14:04	sean	the default tmux ones are designed to not muck with weechat
2013-01-28 19:14:05	sean	but
2013-01-28 19:14:06	sean	well
2013-01-28 19:14:09	sean	I changed most of those
2013-01-28 19:14:13	sean	to be like screen :X
2013-01-28 19:14:19	@pat	>: )
2013-01-28 19:14:46	@pat	I like knowing that screen will never ever ever change or be updated
2013-01-28 19:15:16	sean	yeah
2013-01-28 19:15:17	sean	they gave up
2013-01-28 19:15:23	sean	most of them switched to tmux developmen
2013-01-28 19:15:23	@pat	gave up?
2013-01-28 19:15:25	sean	+t
2013-01-28 19:15:31	@pat	or finished?
2013-01-28 19:15:39	sean	nah
2013-01-28 19:15:44	sean	screen's missing a lot of functionality
2013-01-28 19:15:48	sean	that plugins hacked.
2013-01-28 19:15:53	@pat	what plugin?
2013-01-28 19:15:55	sean	b/c screen can't have plugins.
2013-01-28 19:15:57	@pat	oh
2013-01-28 19:15:58	@pat	I see
2013-01-28 19:15:59	@pat	patches
2013-01-28 19:16:02	sean	Yessir.
2013-01-28 19:16:05	sean	like, code patches.
2013-01-28 19:16:06	sean	n'at.
2013-01-28 19:16:32	sean	screen's just ancient, awful code that can't obviously be modularised
2013-01-28 19:16:44	@pat	so, it suits me?
2013-01-28 19:16:49	sean	so, a lot of the developers now develop tmux, which is future proof
2013-01-28 19:16:57	sean	plugins, scripting engine, vagina, config your heart out.
2013-01-28 19:17:01	sean	supports penises too
2013-01-28 19:17:31	@pat	size comparison?
2013-01-28 19:17:42	@pat	I wonder how the latencies are
2013-01-28 19:17:43	sean	let me find out!
2013-01-28 19:17:49	sean	I don't know how to check that =(
2013-01-28 19:17:49	@pat	if tmux is smaller I'll cry
2013-01-28 19:17:53	sean	Probably is.

2013-01-28 19:20:56	sean	I used my mac's binary size, which uses only x86_64 for screen (since it's from Apple), and I compiled tmux with packed binary support
2013-01-28 19:20:59	sean	meaning it's 32 and 64bit.
2013-01-28 19:21:05	@pat	ah ha

2013-02-03 01:22:56	pat	I can either say, I want to go the hyper realistic route of representing a cell 
2013-02-03 01:23:29	pat	or I want to go another, more-to-the-point idea of building the concept of neurotransmitters in artificial neural networks
2013-02-03 01:23:44	pat	like I can try to build a cell from scratch
2013-02-03 01:24:04	pat	or I can take an artificial neural network and add "neurotransmitters" or phases that the network can go through
2013-02-03 01:24:48	sean	BTW.
2013-02-03 01:24:56	sean	This pizza I bought. Phenominal.
2013-02-03 01:25:02	pat	phenomenal
2013-02-03 01:25:09	sean	*sigh*
2013-02-03 01:25:23	sean	Cette pizza que moi j'ai achetee, c'est phenomenal.
2013-02-03 01:26:48	pat	eh

2013-02-03 01:42:33	pat	http://images.4chan.org/b/src/1359873679143.jpg
2013-02-03 01:42:52	sean	^-^
2013-02-03 01:42:57	sean	Weird.
2013-02-03 01:43:13	sean	Where does this go?
2013-02-03 01:43:16	 *	sean points
2013-02-03 01:43:28	pat	in the butt
2013-02-03 01:43:47	sean	oic.

2013-02-03 01:44:24	pat	considering doing cough medicine again, thoughts?
2013-02-03 01:45:32	sean	you won't
2013-02-03 01:45:32	sean	pussy
2013-02-03 01:45:42	pat	hmm
2013-02-03 01:45:44	pat	okay
2013-02-03 01:46:18	sean	I say do it.
2013-02-03 01:47:33	sean	I've fallen in love with an Arch linux user's scrotwm desktop he's designed.
2013-02-03 01:48:16	sean	http://synergyservers.com/~sean/images/2010-08-25-052430_1600x900_scrot.png
2013-02-03 01:48:25	sean	and
2013-02-03 01:48:42	sean	http://synergyservers.com/~sean/images/2010-08-03-194044_1600x900_scrot.png
2013-02-03 01:48:45	sean	The second being more preferable.
2013-02-03 01:49:17	sean	I feel that simplicity is the most perfect form of sophistication.
2013-02-03 01:50:15	pat	for some reason it doesn't terribly matter much to me
2013-02-03 01:50:52	sean	Leonardo DiVinci was the one to have actually said that:  that simplicity is the ultimate manifestation of sophistication
2013-02-03 01:51:12	pat	sounds good to me
2013-02-03 01:51:14	sean	I do LOVE this pink desktop
2013-02-03 01:51:23	sean	I think the colours are spot on ...
2013-02-03 01:51:34	sean	but yeah, this is scrotwm.
2013-02-03 01:51:45	sean	I can actually have scrot take precedence over my mac's WM.
2013-02-03 01:51:49	sean	but ... I'm not that bold.
2013-02-03 01:52:01	pat	alright
2013-02-03 01:52:15	sean	That's why you should use scrot.
2013-02-03 01:52:27	sean	May I post a good basic version?
2013-02-03 01:52:52	pat	why not? I don't really care about it
2013-02-03 01:52:54	sean	http://www.peereboom.us/scrotwm/html/scrotwm.jpg
2013-02-03 01:53:09	sean	It's a mouseless interface.
2013-02-03 01:53:18	pat	yep
2013-02-03 01:53:28	sean	KDE is plain old icky.
2013-02-03 01:53:31	sean	Gnome is kinda cool.
2013-02-03 01:53:50	pat	mhm
2013-02-03 01:53:55	sean	but from what I know gnome is going through some sort of instability ...
2013-02-03 01:53:57	sean	is this true?
2013-02-03 01:54:05	sean	Like the developers all jumped the metaphorical ship
2013-02-03 01:54:40	pat	maybe, because of gnome 3
2013-02-03 01:54:43	sean	ja.
2013-02-03 01:54:54	sean	I regret so say I don't know why though
2013-02-03 01:54:55	pat	I don't pay attention, because it isn't something that bothers me particularly
2013-02-03 01:55:21	sean	haha --> http://cdn.overclock.net/6/69/6974a11c_2010-01-08-040626_1280x768_scrot.png
2013-02-03 01:55:29	sean	last one I promise.
2013-02-03 01:56:03	pat	alrighty
2013-02-03 01:58:20	sean	I wish I weren't black.
2013-02-03 01:58:52	pat	me too
2013-02-03 01:59:00	pat	I am going to take a sleeping pill and smoke some
2013-02-03 01:59:06	sean	=(
2013-02-03 01:59:25	sean	OH
2013-02-03 01:59:29	sean	I helped my uncle set up his shit.
2013-02-03 01:59:33	sean	I told you
2013-02-03 01:59:42	sean	gay
2013-02-03 01:59:43	sean	GAY
2013-02-03 01:59:55	sean	I figured he'd be pretty impatient, but no ..
2013-02-03 02:00:08	sean	he was totally into getting everything set up and even asked me some pretty good questions
2013-02-03 02:00:13	sean	like what's an ethernet cable do ...
2013-02-03 02:00:17	sean	how does wireless work
2013-02-03 02:00:26	sean	why he needs a password; will the micorwave interfere with this router.
2013-02-03 02:00:28	pat	and so on
2013-02-03 02:00:30	sean	like legit questions ...
2013-02-03 02:01:07	sean	The most typical complex question I get at the store, is "do I really need this?"
2013-02-03 02:01:20	sean	to which I respond . DEEERRRRRRRP GHZHZHHZZZHHZZHZ BEEEEETP DERRRR DERRRR BOOOOOOP
2013-02-03 02:01:23	sean	and usually they get the idea.

2013-02-03 02:05:02	pat	hm?
2013-02-03 02:05:04	sean	I'm seriously tempted to write an IRC client for iOS ...
2013-02-03 02:05:08	sean	all of my options suck dick.
2013-02-03 02:05:16	sean	I'm forced to ssh into m0nster and tmux a sessio
2013-02-03 02:05:18	sean	session*

2013-02-03 02:10:00	sean	b/c the user is limited by the keystrokes they can do ...
2013-02-03 02:11:00	sean	Eww
2013-02-03 02:11:02	sean	that's not MVC: 
2013-02-03 02:11:02	sean	[session setDelegate:controller];
2013-02-03 02:11:03	sean	 [controller setSession:session];

2013-02-28 20:24:29	sean	I spend a good 9 to 10 hours a day masturbating.
2013-02-28 20:24:41	@pat	oh.
2013-02-28 20:24:44	@pat	my question
2013-02-28 20:25:08	@pat	do you switch hands every 30 minutes or do you just switch per hour? wondering what's easiest
2013-02-28 20:25:16	@pat	also, how do you keep your dick from chafing after so much friction?
2013-02-28 20:25:49	sean	I have a system that extracts the olive oil I use whlist cooking pasta, and it keeps my penis+hand(s) connection very smooth
2013-02-28 20:25:54	sean	chaffing is to a minimum.
2013-02-28 20:26:13	sean	I frequently however alternate between grabbing my dick with both hands, xor both my feet at a time.
2013-02-28 20:26:15	@pat	automatic penis greaser
2013-02-28 20:26:25	@pat	that's tricky shit
2013-02-28 20:26:36	@pat	it's easier when your penis is where your belly button should be
2013-02-28 20:26:44	sean	Indeed.
